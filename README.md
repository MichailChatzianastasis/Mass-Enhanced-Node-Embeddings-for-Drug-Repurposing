**The multiscale interactome is a powerful approach to explain disease treatment.** **(a)** Existing network approaches assume that drugs treat diseases by targeting proteins that are close to disease proteins in a network of physical interactions. However, drugs can also treat diseases by targeting distant proteins that affect the same biological functions. **(b)** The multiscale interactome models drug-disease treatments by integrating both proteins and a hierarchy of biological functions. **(c)** The diffusion profile of a drug or disease captures its effect on every protein and biological function. **(d)** By comparing the diffusion profiles of a drug and a disease, the multiscale interactome predicts drug-disease treatment, identifies proteins and biological functions related to treatment, and predicts genes that alter a treatment's efficacy and adverse reactions.

For a detailed description of the multiscale interactome and its applications, please refer to our preprint [Identification of disease treatment mechanisms through the multiscale interactome](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.30.069690v3) (2020).

## Data
All data is available at http://snap.stanford.edu/multiscale-interactome/data/data.tar.gz. To download the data, please run the following code in the same directory this project is cloned to. This should result in a data/ folder populated with the relevant data.
```

wget http://snap.stanford.edu/multiscale-interactome/data/data.tar.gz
tar -xvf data.tar.gz
```

## Setup
Code is written in Python3. Please install the packages present in the requirements.txt file. You may use:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using the multiscale interactome
Sample code to construct the multiscale interactome and compute diffusion profiles is provided in main.ipynb.

To construct the multiscale interactome:
```
msi = MSI()
msi.load()
```

To calculate diffusion profiles with optimized edge weights, use the code below. Note that our implementation is parallelized and you will need to explicitly set the number of cores under num_cores.
```
dp = DiffusionProfiles(alpha = 0.8595436247434408, max_iter = 1000, tol = 1e-06, weights = {'down_biological_function': 4.4863053901688685, 'indication': 3.541889556309463, 'biological_function': 6.583155399238509, 'up_biological_function': 2.09685000906964, 'protein': 4.396695660380823, 'drug': 3.2071696595616364}, num_cores = int(multiprocessing.cpu_count()/2) - 4, save_load_file_path = "results/")

dp.calculate_diffusion_profiles(msi)
```

To load saved diffusion profiles, use:
```
dp_saved = DiffusionProfiles(alpha = None, max_iter = None, tol = None, weights = None, num_cores = None, save_load_file_path = "results/")

msi.load_saved_node_idx_mapping_and_nodelist(dp_saved.save_load_file_path)
dp_saved.load_diffusion_profiles(msi.drugs_in_graph + msi.indications_in_graph)
```

To view a diffusion profile, use:
```
# Diffusion profile for Rosuvastatin (DB01098)
dp_saved.drug_or_indication2diffusion_profile["DB01098"]
```
